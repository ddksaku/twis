Hide from your administration functions you don't need!

== Description ==

There are always parts in your Wordpress administration you don't currently need. This plugin makes it easy to them - unnecessary menu items or any of the boxes on the posting screen (like custom fields or trackback box). Unclutter the administration and work faster.

You can also input your own CSS code to modify the look of administration.

For more information, support, giving feedback, reporting problems (thank you for that!) or anything else - see the [official plugin's page](http://kahi.cz/wordpress/wp-lite-plugin/).

= Requirements =

**PHP 5** on your server is necessary to run this plugin.
